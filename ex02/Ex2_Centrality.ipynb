    "Centrality is a key concept in social network analysis. It measures the importance or influence of a certain node/edge in a network. The interpretation of importance or influence, however, depends on the type of centrality and the application. Different types of centrality were discussed in the lecture: degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality.<br>\n",
    "In this exercise, you are going to implement different centrality algorithms using the NetworkX library which you already know from last exercise. Please consult the [reference](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/index.html) [1] and the [tutorial](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/tutorial.html) [2]."
