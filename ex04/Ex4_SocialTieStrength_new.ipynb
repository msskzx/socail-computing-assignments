    "# Social Computing/Social Gaming - Summer 2023\n",
    "# Exercise Sheet 4 - Social Tie Strength\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you are going to predict Tie Strength in a social network using the method explained in the paper _E. Gilbert and K. Karahalios: Predicting Tie Strength With Social Media_ [1], of which a short introduction is provided to you in the exercise files. According to Mark Granovetter, the strength of a tie between two persons is a combination of the amount of time, the emotional intensity, the intimacy and the reciprocal services which characterize it. Using variables that describe these categories, we want to find out how much each one of these features contributes in order to predict the strength of ties not previously known.<br>\n",
    "An important prerequisite to this exercise is understanding the basic concept of linear regression models. As mentioned in the lecture, a recommended reading is chapter 3 of _C. Bishop: Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning_ [2], which you can find on [Moodle](https://www.moodle.tum.de/) [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tie Strength Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "In social network analysis, the Tie Strength between two people measures how strong their relationship is. The paper above describes the procedure of deriving available information (different variables) about a connection between two persons from an online social network and using it in order to discover how close they are. The ultimate goal is to build a model using the given information, finding out which variables account most for the Tie Strength and using that model later on to predict social Tie Strength when only the predictive (or explanatory) variables are available. Before being able to predict anything, we need to find out whether the given variables are suitable for prediction in the first place. This can be done via creating and evaluating a **multiple linear regression model**. 'Multiple' here refers to having more than one predictive variable in an regression model.<br>\n",
    "In the paper mentioned above, 67 variables where used in the linear model to predict the Tie Strength. In our simplified model, we are going to use only 10 predictive variables which are:\n",
    "* number of friends\n",
    "* number of friends's friends\n",
    "* days since last communication\n",
    "* shared appearances in photos\n",
    "* wall intimacy words\n",
    "* inbox intimacy words\n",
    "* days since first communication\n",
    "* number of mutual friends\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use a simplified form of the paper's linear model:\n",
    "$$y_i = \\alpha + \\beta X_i + \\epsilon_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y_i$ is the dependent variable (also referred to as target value, which is the Tie Strength in our case) of the $i$-th friend of a person. $X_i$ is the predictive vector, containing the (predictive) variables listed above. $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are the model's parameters, where $\\alpha$ is the intercept/bias, $\\beta$ the coefficient vector containing coefficients for each predictive variable, and $\\epsilon$ the prediction error. The regression problem boils down to calculating the model's parameters given a certain ground truth; meaning that for some connections, the Tie Strength has to be already known for building the model. That way, the unknown Tie Strengths can be predicted using the regression model by simply inserting the values into the vector. The coefficients for each predictive variable will show us the importance of the respective variable for the social Tie Strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The input to your Python program is a directed social network _SocialGraph.gml_. As the first step, you will visualize the graph with NetworkX to get an overview over the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the ground truth (Tie Strength in our case) is usually retrieved by participant's answers to surveys on how strong their relationship is with another person - this is why the graph is directed: two people might have varying views. The ground truth is available in the file. About 70% of the edges have valid values for the `tieStrength` variable, which should be used for training. For about 30% of the edges, the variable is set to -1 (equivalent to unknown). These represent the prediction set for which the Tie Strength should be predicted using the linear regression model later. But first, that model needs to be computed and checked for its goodness of fit."
