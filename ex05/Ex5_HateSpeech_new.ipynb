    "# Exercise Sheet 5 - Hate Speech\n",
    "Online hate speech is a large scale phenomenon that gained more and more traction in modern society in recent years. Violence attributed to online hate speech has increased worldwide. The same technology that allows social media to galvanize activist movements and NGOs can be used by hate/crime groups seeking to organize and recruit. It also allows conspiration theorists to reach audiences far broader than their core community. It is time – now more than ever –  to put systems in place that make sure social media is not used as a tool to conduct criminal activities. Fortunately, modern technology allows us to do just that.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise sheet, we will attempt to accurately and automatically detect two instances of hate speech in Twitter: sexism and racism. The first step in this process will be to prepare the data before it is fed to the model. We do this with the help of the Universal Sentence Encoder, which is explained in more detail later. Additionally, we also need to encode the labels and split the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then take two different approaches in classifying the data. In other words, we will create, train, evaluate and compare two models. One of them is purely based on text (the Base Model) and the other also takes the social context of the users into account (the Social Model)."

    "## Why Twitter?\n",
    "Hate crimes are communicative acts, often provoked by events that incite retribution in a targeted group. The continued growth of online social networks and micro-blogging Web services, such as Twitter, enable an extensive and near real-time data source through which the analysis of hateful and antagonistic responses to “trigger” events can be undertaken. Such data affords researchers with the possibility to measure the online social mood and emotion following large-scale, disruptive, and emotive events. Twitter is a defensible and logical source of data for such analysis given that users of social media are more likely to express emotional content due to deindividuation (anonymity, lack of self-awareness in groups, disinhibition) [1]."
