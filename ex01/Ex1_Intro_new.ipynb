    "To get you prepared for using Python in the upcoming exercise sheets we will introduce some of Python's most important features on the example of sparse vectors. The basic idea is that sparse vectors (vectors whose positions are mostly zero) can be represented more efficiently by only saving a list of tuples containing the valueable data's position and its data. For example (0,0,0,4,0,0,42) would be represented by [(3,4),(6,42)]."
